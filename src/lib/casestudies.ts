    turnaround: '28 days',
    challenge: 'Bistro 57 had been using off-the-shelf polos from a general supplier. The fit was inconsistent, the embroidery quality was poor, and the color faded after a few washes. With a new location opening, they needed a uniform that matched the quality of their dining experience.',
    solution: 'We sourced 220 GSM pique cotton in two colorways — white for daytime service, charcoal for evening. The Bistro 57 logo was embroidered at chest with a custom thread match to their brand Pantone. Each piece was washed and inspected before dispatch.',
    result: 'All 120 pieces delivered 2 days ahead of the new location opening. Zero rejections. The client reordered an additional 40 pieces two months later.',

    challenge: 'Northstar was opening a flagship gym and wanted to give every founding member a welcome kit — matching shorts and tee with the Northstar mark. The pieces needed to look sharp in the gym and hold up through heavy wash cycles.',
    solution: 'We used 200 GSM combed cotton for the tees and 220 GSM cotton shorts. Both screen printed with a single-color Northstar mark. The tees were regular fit — versatile enough to wear in and out of the gym. Everything was packed into a branded mailer box.',
    result: 'All 160 pieces delivered on time. Member feedback on the kit was strong enough that Northstar added a retail component — they now sell the kit in-gym to non-members.',

    challenge: 'Creative studios have a unique merch challenge — their team has high standards and will not wear something that feels cheap or generic. House of Craft wanted pieces that looked like they came from a proper clothing brand, not a corporate swag vendor.',
    solution: 'We built a small drop — 50 boxy fit hoodies in off-white with a screen printed back graphic and embroidered chest mark, plus 25 canvas totes. The hoodie was 320 GSM — heavy enough to feel substantial. The back graphic was a custom illustration provided by their in-house design team.',
